# About
Atmosphere Cheat Button Assigner is a tool that I made for use with Atmosphere codes on the Nintendo Switch. This will accept codes as input and allow you to change any button activators present in the code. This will allow anyone to modify pre-existing codes with their own desired activators, regardless of coding knowledge level. This will also be useful for cheat creators to release their codes with activators formatted using placeholders (such as 8000XXXX) and then allow the users to choose the activator.

# Usage
1) Paste your Atmosphere codes into the text box, or open them from any txt file. Input formatting does not matter.
2) Click the "Load Codes" button.
3) Use the "Next Activator" and "Previous Activator" buttons to cycle through any present button activators.
4) To change an activator, check/uncheck the appropriate boxes and click "Save Current Activator" when done.
5) All the new codes will be in the same text box. Copy them wherever you want.
